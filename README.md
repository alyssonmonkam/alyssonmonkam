I am a recent Environmental Geoscience graduate with a passion for data analysis and sustainability. With hands-on experience in Python, SQL, and data visualisation tools like Tableau, I have worked on environmental research projects and completed a data technician bootcamp to enhance technical skills. Previous roles in market research and fundraising have strengthened communication and problem-solving abilities. Fluent in French and eager to apply analytical skills, I am focused on contributing to data-driven solutions in a collaborative environment.
